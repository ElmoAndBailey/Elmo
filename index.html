          <div><p>I believe that Elmo should be president because he has beliefs. He wishes the best on all people, and has actual intelligence. He can convince anyone anywhere to be happy.
          He won't let anyone in the world be seperated from the one's they love.</p>
          <p>Although Elmo would be a great president and make everything fun for everyone, I believe that he would also be responsibele. Yes, he would try to make everything fair for everyone,
          but that is one of the reasons many people would doubt his abilities as our country's leader. I think that Elmo would try too hard to make EVERYONE happy instead of worrying about the 
          general population.</p>
          <p>Elmo has his faults. Just like everyone else in the world. Elmo worrying about each singular entity is better than worrying about no one but himself, like...some people. He would make a great leader, and
          y'all are gonna realize that by the end of this page.</p></div>
